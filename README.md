# [untitled social justice resource center]

This folder contains code for a web interface named the "untitled social justice resource center". This interface allows the user to search through news articles pertaining to social justice from the New York Times using the New York Times Article Search API (https://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json). 

## features

1. We have included a search feature based on key words. For example, if a user entered the word "LGBTQ", the search feature would find articles relating to said word and display previews of them on a page. If the user clicks on any of the article previews the user is redirected to the article.

2. Our web interface includes a search feature widget based on dates as well which lets a user find articles on a topic that were written on or after said date. User inputs keyword into above "search" field and then specifies a date into the date widget. Once search has been conducted articles relating to the key word that were written on and after the date that was specified.

3. There are navigation buttons located on the pages used to display the article previews after searches are conducted. These buttons are labeled "next" and "back". If the user clicks on the "next" button (2 clicks) then they are taken to the next page of results from the conducted search. Conversely, if the "back" button is pressed (2 clicks) the user is taken to the previous page of results from the conducted search

4. On the same navbar that contains the "search" and "date" features there is a button entitled "resources" that brings user to a page containing links to multiple different resources to help users with social justice issues. These resources are separated into several categories including, but not limited to: equality, LGBTQ+, and women.
